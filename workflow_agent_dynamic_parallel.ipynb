But even as they are largely consistent in their predictions for the evolution of technology itself, they are deeply divided on how advances in AI and robotics will impact the economic and employment picture over the next decade.\\nWe call this a canvassing because it is not a representative, randomized survey. Its findings emerge from an “opt in” invitation to experts who have been identified by researching those who are widely quoted as technology builders and analysts and those who have made insightful predictions to our previous queries about the future of the Internet. (For more details, please see the section “About this Report and Survey.”)\\nKey themes: reasons to be hopeful\\nAdvances in technology may displace certain types of work, but historically they have been a net creator of jobs.\\nWe will adapt to these changes by inventing entirely new types of work, and by taking advantage of uniquely human capabilities.\\nTechnology will free us from day-to-day drudgery, and allow us to define our relationship with “work” in a more positive and socially beneficial way.\\nUltimately, we as a society control our own destiny through the choices we make.\\nKey themes: reasons to be concerned\\nImpacts from automation have thus far impacted mostly blue-collar employment; the coming wave of innovation threatens to upend white-collar work as well.\\nCertain highly-skilled workers will succeed wildly in this new environment—but far more may be displaced into lower paying service industry jobs at best, or permanent unemployment at worst.\\nOur educational system is not adequately preparing us for work of the future, and our political and economic institutions are poorly equipped to handle these hard choices.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Some 1,896 experts responded to the following question:\\nThe economic impact of robotic advances and AI—Self-driving cars, intelligent digital agents that can act for you, and robots are advancing rapidly. Will networked, automated, artificial intelligence (AI) applications and robotic devices have displaced more jobs than they have created by 2025?\\nHalf of these experts (48%) envision a future in which robots and digital agents have displaced significant numbers of both blue- and white-collar workers—with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality, masses of people who are effectively unemployable, and breakdowns in the social order.\\nThe other half of the experts who responded to this survey (52%) expect that technology will not displace more jobs than it creates by 2025. To be sure, this group anticipates that many jobs currently performed by humans will be substantially taken over by robots or digital agents by 2025. But they have faith that human ingenuity will create new jobs, industries, and ways to make a living, just as it has been doing since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.\\nThese two groups also share certain hopes and concerns about the impact of technology on employment. For instance, many are concerned that our existing social structures—and especially our educational institutions—are not adequately preparing people for the skills that will be needed in the job market of the future. Conversely, others have hope that the coming changes will be an opportunity to reassess our society’s relationship to employment itself—by returning to a focus on small-scale or artisanal modes of production, or by giving people more time to spend on leisure, self-improvement, or time with loved ones.\\nA number of themes ran through the responses to this question: those that are unique to either group, and those that were mentioned by members of both groups.\\nThe view from those who expect AI and robotics to have a positive or neutral impact on jobs by 2025'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='JP Rangaswami, chief scientist for Salesforce.com, offered a number of reasons for his belief that automation will not be a net displacer of jobs in the next decade: “The effects will be different in different economies (which themselves may look different from today’s political boundaries). Driven by revolutions in education and in technology, the very nature of work will have changed radically—but only in economies that have chosen to invest in education, technology, and related infrastructure. Some classes of jobs will be handed over to the ‘immigrants’ of AI and Robotics, but more will have been generated in creative and curating activities as demand for their services grows exponentially while barriers to entry continue to fall. For many classes of jobs, robots will continue to be poor labor substitutes.”\\nRangaswami’s prediction incorporates a number of arguments made by those in this canvassing who took his side of this question.\\nArgument #1: Throughout history, technology has been a job creator—not a job destroyer\\nJonathan Grudin, principal researcher for Microsoft, concurred: “Technology will continue to disrupt jobs, but more jobs seem likely to be created. When the world population was a few hundred million people there were hundreds of millions of jobs. Although there have always been unemployed people, when we reached a few billion people there were billions of jobs. There is no shortage of things that need to be done and that will not change.”\\nArgument #2: Advances in technology create new jobs and industries even as they displace some of the older ones'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Amy Webb, CEO of strategy firm Webbmedia Group, wrote, “There is a general concern that the robots are taking over. I disagree that our emerging technologies will permanently displace most of the workforce, though I’d argue that jobs will shift into other sectors. Now more than ever, an army of talented coders is needed to help our technology advance. But we will still need folks to do packaging, assembly, sales, and outreach. The collar of the future is a hoodie.”\\nArgument #3: There are certain jobs that only humans have the capacity to do\\nA number of respondents argued that many jobs require uniquely human characteristics such as empathy, creativity, judgment, or critical thinking—and that jobs of this nature will never succumb to widespread automation.\\nMichael Glassman, associate professor at the Ohio State University, wrote, “I think AI will do a few more things, but people are going to be surprised how limited it is. There will be greater differentiation between what AI does and what humans do, but also much more realization that AI will not be able to engage the critical tasks that humans do.”\\nArgument #4: The technology will not advance enough in the next decade to substantially impact the job market\\nAnother group of experts feels that the impact on employment is likely to be minimal for the simple reason that 10 years is too short a timeframe for automation to move substantially beyond the factory floor. David Clark, a senior research scientist at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, noted, “The larger trend to consider is the penetration of automation into service jobs. This trend will require new skills for the service industry, which may challenge some of the lower-tier workers, but in 12 years I do not think autonomous devices will be truly autonomous. I think they will allow us to deliver a higher level of service with the same level of human involvement.”\\nChristopher Wilkinson, a retired European Union official, board member for EURid.eu, and Internet Society leader said, “The vast majority of the population will be untouched by these technologies for the foreseeable future. AI and robotics will be a niche, with a few leading applications such as banking, retailing, and transport. The risks of error and the imputation of liability remain major constraints to the application of these technologies to the ordinary landscape.”'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Argument #5: Our social, legal, and regulatory structures will minimize the impact on employment\\nA final group suspects that economic, political, and social concerns will prevent the widespread displacement of jobs. Glenn Edens, a director of research in networking, security, and distributed systems within the Computer Science Laboratory at PARC, a Xerox Company, wrote, “There are significant technical and policy issues yet to resolve, however there is a relentless march on the part of commercial interests (businesses) to increase productivity so if the technical advances are reliable and have a positive ROI then there is a risk that workers will be displaced. Ultimately we need a broad and large base of employed population, otherwise there will be no one to pay for all of this new world.”\\nAndrew Rens, chief council at the Shuttleworth Foundation, wrote, “A fundamental insight of economics is that an entrepreneur will only supply goods or services if there is a demand, and those who demand the good can pay. Therefore any country that wants a competitive economy will ensure that most of its citizens are employed so that in turn they can pay for goods and services. If a country doesn’t ensure employment driven demand it will become increasingly less competitive.”'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='The view from those who expect AI and robotics to displace more jobs than they create by 2025\\nAn equally large group of experts takes a diametrically opposed view of technology’s impact on employment. In their reading of history, job displacement as a result of technological advancement is clearly in evidence today, and can only be expected to get worse as automation comes to the white-collar world.\\nArgument #1: Displacement of workers from automation is already happening—and about to get much worse\\n\\n[also]\\nArgument #2: The consequences for income inequality will be profound\\nFor those who expect AI and robotics to significantly displace human employment, these displacements seem certain to lead to an increase in income inequality, a continued hollowing out of the middle class, and even riots, social unrest, and/or the creation of a permanent, unemployable “underclass”.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='[said that he]\\nAlex Howard, a writer and editor based in Washington, D.C., said, “I expect that automation and AI will have had a substantial impact on white-collar jobs, particularly back-office functions in clinics, in law firms, like medical secretaries, transcriptionists, or paralegals. Governments will have to collaborate effectively with technology companies and academic institutions to provide massive retraining efforts over the next decade to prevent massive social disruption from these changes.”\\nPoint of agreement: The educational system is doing a poor job of preparing the next generation of workers\\nA consistent theme among both groups is that our existing social institutions—especially the educational system—are not up to the challenge of preparing workers for the technology- and robotics-centric nature of employment in the future.\\nPoint of agreement: The concept of “work” may change significantly in the coming decade\\nOn a more hopeful note, a number of experts expressed a belief that the coming changes will allow us to renegotiate the existing social compact around work and employment.\\nPossibility #1: We will experience less drudgery and more leisure time\\nFrancois-Dominique Armingaud, retired computer software engineer from IBM and now giving security courses to major engineering schools, responded, “The main purpose of progress now is to allow people to spend more life with their loved ones instead of spoiling it with overtime while others are struggling in order to access work.”\\nPossibility #2: It will free us from the industrial age notion of what a “job” is\\nA notable number of experts take it for granted that many of tomorrow’s jobs will be held by robots or digital agents—and express hope that this will inspire us as a society to completely redefine our notions of work and employment.\\nPeter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz, founders of the online community Awakening Technology, based in Portland, Oregon, wrote, “Many things need to be done to care for, teach, feed, and heal others that are difficult to monetize. If technologies replace people in some jobs and roles, what kinds of social support or safety nets will make it possible for them to contribute to the common good through other means? Think outside the job.”'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Bob Frankston, an Internet pioneer and technology innovator whose work helped allow people to have control of the networking (internet) within their homes, wrote, “We’ll need to evolve the concept of a job as a means of wealth distribution as we did in response to the invention of the sewing machine displacing seamstressing as welfare.”\\nJim Hendler, an architect of the evolution of the World Wide Web and professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, wrote, “The notion of work as a necessity for life cannot be sustained if the great bulk of manufacturing and such moves to machines—but humans will adapt by finding new models of payment as they did in the industrial revolution (after much upheaval).”\\nTim Bray, an active participant in the IETF and technology industry veteran, wrote, “It seems inevitable to me that the proportion of the population that needs to engage in traditional full-time employment, in order to keep us fed, supplied, healthy, and safe, will decrease. I hope this leads to a humane restructuring of the general social contract around employment.”\\nPossibility #3: We will see a return to uniquely “human” forms of production\\nAnother group of experts anticipates that pushback against expanding automation will lead to a revolution in small-scale, artisanal, and handmade modes of production.\\nKevin Carson, a senior fellow at the Center for a Stateless Society and contributor to the P2P Foundation blog, wrote, “I believe the concept of ‘jobs’ and ‘employment’ will be far less meaningful, because the main direction of technological advance is toward cheap production tools (e.g., desktop information processing tools or open-source CNC garage machine tools) that undermine the material basis of the wage system. The real change will not be the stereotypical model of ‘technological unemployment,’ with robots displacing workers in the factories, but increased employment in small shops, increased project-based work on the construction industry model, and increased provisioning in the informal and household economies and production for gift, sharing, and barter.”\\n[efforts]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='A network scientist for BBN Technologies wrote, “To some degree, this is already happening. In terms of the large-scale, mass-produced economy, the utility of low-skill human workers is rapidly diminishing, as many blue-collar jobs (e.g., in manufacturing) and white-collar jobs (e.g., processing insurance paperwork) can be handled much more cheaply by automated systems. And we can already see some hints of reaction to this trend in the current economy: entrepreneurially-minded unemployed and underemployed people are taking advantages of sites like Etsy and TaskRabbit to market quintessentially human skills. And in response, there is increasing demand for ‘artisanal’ or ‘hand-crafted’ products that were made by a human. In the long run this trend will actually push toward the re-localization and re-humanization of the economy, with the 19th- and 20th-century economies of scale exploited where they make sense (cheap, identical, disposable goods), and human-oriented techniques (both older and newer) increasingly accounting for goods and services that are valuable, customized, or long-lasting.”\\nPoint of agreement: Technology is not destiny … we control the future we will inhabit\\nIn the end, a number of these experts took pains to note that none of these potential outcomes—from the most utopian to most dystopian—are etched in stone. Although technological advancement often seems to take on a mind of its own, humans are in control of the political, social, and economic systems that will ultimately determine whether the coming wave of technological change has a positive or negative impact on jobs and employment.\\nSeth Finkelstein, a programmer, consultant and EFF Pioneer of the Electronic Frontier Award winner, responded, “The technodeterminist-negative view, that automation means jobs loss, end of story, versus the technodeterminist-positive view, that more and better jobs will result, both seem to me to make the error of confusing potential outcomes with inevitability. Thus, a technological advance by itself can either be positive or negative for jobs, depending on the social structure as a whole….this is not a technological consequence; rather it’s a political choice.”'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Jason Pontin, editor in chief and publisher of the MIT Technology Review, responded, “There’s no economic law that says the jobs eliminated by new technologies will inevitably be replaced by new jobs in new markets… All of this is manageable by states and economies: but it will require wrestling with ideologically fraught solutions, such as a guaranteed minimum income, and a broadening of our social sense of what is valuable work.”\\n \\n\\t\\t\\tNext: About this\\xa0Report and Survey'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='← Prev Page \\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \\nNext Page → \\n\\n\\n\\nSign up for our weekly newsletterFresh data delivered Saturday mornings\\n\\nEmail Address\\n\\nSubmit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for subscribing!\\n\\nProcessing…\\n\\n\\n\\nSign up for The BriefingWeekly updates on the world of news & information\\nSign Up\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics\\nArtificial IntelligenceBusiness & WorkplaceEmerging TechnologyFuture of the Internet (Project)Future of WorkTechnology Adoption\\nShare This Link:\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\nFacebook\\nThreads\\nLinkedIn\\nWhatsApp\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nshort readsJun 25, 2025 \\n\\n   \\n\\n34% of U.S. adults have used ChatGPT, about double the share in 2023 \\nreportMay 23, 2025 \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhat Web Browsing Data Tells Us About How AI Appears Online \\nshort readsApr 28, 2025 \\n\\n   \\n\\nAmericans largely foresee AI having negative effects on news, journalists \\nshort readsApr 3, 2025 \\n\\n   \\n\\nQ&A: Why and how we compared the public’s views of artificial intelligence with those of AI experts \\nreportApr 3, 2025 \\n\\n   \\n\\nHow the U.S. Public and AI Experts View Artificial Intelligence \\n\\n\\n\\nMost Popular\\n1How Americans view the GOP’s budget and tax bill\\n2Dissatisfaction with democracy remains widespread in many nations\\n3Behind Trump’s 2024 Victory, a More Racially and Ethnically Diverse Voter Coalition\\n4India’s Sex Ratio at Birth Begins To Normalize\\n5What the data says about food stamps in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of ContentsTable of Contents \\n\\nAI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout this\\xa0Report and Survey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPredictions for the State of AI and Robotics in 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViews from Those Who Expect AI and Robotics to Have a Positive or Neutral Impact on Jobs by 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViews from Those Who Expect AI and Robotics to Displace More Jobs than They Create by 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAreas Where Both Groups Agree'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/', 'title': 'AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs', 'description': 'Experts envision automation and intelligent digital agents permeating vast areas of our work and personal lives by 2025, but they are divided on whether these advances will displace more jobs than they create.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='901 E St. NW, Suite 300Washington,\\xa0DC\\xa020004USA(+1) 202-419-4300\\xa0|\\xa0Main(+1) 202-857-8562\\xa0|\\xa0Fax(+1) 202-419-4372\\xa0|\\xa0Media Inquiries\\n\\n\\n\\nResearch Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolitics & Policy\\nInternational Affairs\\nImmigration & Migration\\nRace & Ethnicity\\nReligion\\nAge & Generations\\nGender & LGBTQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily & Relationships\\nEconomy & Work\\nScience\\nInternet & Technology\\nNews Habits & Media\\nMethodological Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\nEmail Newsletters\\nYouTube\\nInstagram\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nX\\nBluesky\\nRSS Feed\\n\\n\\n\\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER\\xa0Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

Since then, as companies have raced to leverage this technology, the value created in industries best positioned to use AI has skyrocketed.\\nThat’s clearly great for businesses, but how is this rapid transformation affecting jobs?\\nTo find out, PwC analysed AI’s impact on both augmentable jobs (jobs that contain many tasks in which AI can enhance or support human judgment and expertise), and automatable jobs (jobs that contain many tasks that can be autonomously completed by AI).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustries more exposed to AI have 3x higher growth in revenue per employee\\nAI can make workers more productive and enable them to create more value. Since 2022 when awareness of AI's power surged, revenue growth in industries best positioned to adopt AI has nearly quadrupled. This suggests that investments in AI are paying off.

For now, she says, blue collar workers might be \"safer\" from AI-related job cuts than white-collar workers.\"In recent months, job security has been stronger in the trades than in many traditional white collar jobs,\" Nich Tremper, senior economist at business software company Gusto, told CNBC Make It in April.Lister urges companies to consider \"the real need to upgrade skills\" and prepare their employees for the AI boom.In Lister\\'s view, AI has the potential to streamline productivity, take over busywork and help workers avoid burnout.\"I think it will make us a whole lot more intelligent, a whole lot more efficient, and allow us to do the jobs that we as humans are good at,\" she says.However, she says, \"unless we take a step backward and train people to make the most of it, it\\'s going to be hard,\" adding that she foresees \"a lot of unemployment.\"Still, according to Lister, it\\'s not yet time to panic: AI still has a long way to go before'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/23/ais-impact-on-the-job-market-is-inevitable-says-workforce-expert.html', 'title': \"AI's impact on the job market is ‘inevitable,’ says workforce expert\", 'description': \"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced job cuts due to AI.

      "### Job Roles Vulnerable to AI Automation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Customer Service Representatives**\n",
      "  - AI can automate responses to repetitive queries, reducing the need for human interaction.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Receptionists**\n",
      "  - Increasingly replaced by robots that manage calls and interact with guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Accountants/Bookkeepers**\n",
      "  - AI streamlines bookkeeping processes, making them more efficient and cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact of AI on the Job Market\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Job Displacement vs. Job Creation**\n",
      "  - While AI is expected to displace jobs, particularly in administrative and customer service roles, it is also anticipated to create new roles that require specialized skills in AI management and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Statistics and Predictions**\n",
      "  - A World Economic Forum report indicates that 48% of U.S. employers plan to reduce their workforce due to AI advancements.\n",
      "  - Amazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned workforce reductions linked to AI-driven efficiency.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Expert Opinions**\n",
      "  - Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic) predicts that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, potentially raising unemployment rates to 10–20%.\n",
      "  - Kai-Fu Lee supports this concern, projecting significant job losses by 2027.\n",
      "  - Conversely, 52% of experts believe that technology will create more jobs than it displaces by 2025, emphasizing the potential for human ingenuity to foster new industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific IT Roles at Risk\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Vulnerable Sectors**\n",
      "  - Clerical, legal, finance, and data processing roles are particularly susceptible to automation due to their structured and routine nature.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Entry-Level Positions**\n",
      "  - Young workers in entry-level roles face high risks of elimination, as these positions often involve repetitive tasks easily automated by AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is reshaping the job landscape, automating various roles predominantly in customer service and administrative sectors. While there is significant concern about job displacement, particularly for entry-level and routine-based roles, there is also optimism about the emergence of new job opportunities in AI management and development. The overall impact of AI on the workforce is expected to be a transformation rather than a straightforward reduction in jobs, with varying opinions on the extent of displacement versus the creation of new roles.\n"
